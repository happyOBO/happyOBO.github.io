I have used the two Github accounts alternately so far. So one account created a repository, and the other used to commit. It's like the owner of the house doesn't live in the house, and someone else goes in and out. I will be using only one account. Good bye gmail addr!
Commit records prior to today can be found at: ([imYOONG's Github](https://github.com/imYOONG))



```
obo***@icloud.com // current acount
jmi***@gmail.com // previous used account
```
